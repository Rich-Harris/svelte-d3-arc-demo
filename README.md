# svelte-d3-arc-demo

https://svelte-d3-arc-demo.surge.sh

This simple demo shows Svelte and d3-shape working together. The visualisation is prebaked on each deploy, but there's also an interactive JavaScript version (drag the slider, pointlessly).

Made in response to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/839521783552294914) â€” Svelte is as general-purpose as they come, and this app's JavaScript weighs less than 5kb. (Not sure about GPU-optimised...)
